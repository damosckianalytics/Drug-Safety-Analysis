Drug Safety – Hypothesis Testing
Overview / Introduction
GlobalXYZ, a pharmaceutical company, recently carried out a clinical trial to test a new medication. To promote openness and trust, they shared the results with a non-profit organisation focused on drug safety. This project explores the results to see whether the drug caused any significant side effects, and whether certain groups (like older people) were more affected than others.

# Objectives

i.	To find out if people who took the drug experienced more side effects than those who took a placebo.
ii.	To examine how many side effects individuals had.
iii.	To explore whether factors like age influenced the results.
iv.	To support safe decision-making based on data.

#Data Source

i.	Dataset: drug_safety.csv
ii.	Includes: gender, age, treatment type (drug or placebo), blood test results, presence of side effects, and number of side effects.
iii.	Source: Based on data from Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics (via Hbiostat), with some columns simplified for this analysis.

# Tools Used

i.	Python (for data analysis)
ii.	Pandas (to work with data tables)
iii.	NumPy (for calculations)
iv.	Matplotlib & Seaborn (for graphs)
v.	Statsmodels & Pingouin (for statistical tests)
vi.	Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for running the analysis)

# Insights

i.	People in the drug group were more likely to report side effects than those in the placebo group.
ii.	Some individuals experienced multiple side effects.
iii.	Age distribution between the two groups was different and may have affected the results.
iv.	The number of side effects was linked to the treatment group, suggesting the drug had a real effect.

# Key Findings

i.	Side effects were clearly more common among those who took the drug.
ii.	The number of side effects per person was not random—it was influenced by whether they took the drug or not.
iii.	Age differences between the groups were meaningful and should be taken into account in future research.

# Recommendation

Care should be taken when giving this drug, especially to older adults. Further testing is recommended to better understand who is most at risk of side effects. Doctors and researchers should continue monitoring the drug’s safety and consider age and other factors before widespread use.

# How to Use This Repository

i.	Download or open the project files provided.
ii.	Read through the notebook to follow the analysis step by step.
iii.	All findings are clearly explained using charts, summaries, and conclusions.
iv.	No coding experience is needed to understand the results.
